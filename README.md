`Warning:` Angle estimation is only as good as the pose estimation algorithm, i.e., it is not perfect.\
`Warning:` Results are acceptable only if the persons move in the 2D plane (sagittal or frontal plane). The persons need to be filmed as parallel as possible to the motion plane.\
If you need 3D research-grade markerless joint kinematics, consider using several cameras with **[Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim)**.

<!--`Warning:` Google Colab does not follow the European GDPR requirements regarding data privacy. [Install locally](#installation) if this matters.-->

<!--`Know issue`: Results won't be good with some iPhone videos in portrait mode (unless you are working on Colab). This is solved by priorly converting them with `ffmpeg -i video_input.mov video_output.mp4`, or even more simply with any random online video converter such as https://video-converter.com.-->

## Installation and Demonstration

### Installation

<!--- OPTION 0: **Use Colab** \
  User-friendly (but full) version, also works on a phone or a tablet.\
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://bit.ly/Sports2D_Colab)\
  YouTube tutorial:\
  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5RpcJ8o1Y"><img src="Content/Video_tuto_Sports2D_Colab.png" width="380"></a>
  
-->

#### Quick install

> N.B.: Full install is required for OpenSim inverse kinematics.

Open a terminal. Type `python -V` to make sure python >=3.10 <=3.12 is installed. If not, install it [from there](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Run:
``` cmd
pip install sports2d
```

Alternatively, build from source to test the last changes:
``` cmd
git clone https://github.com/davidpagnon/sports2d.git
cd sports2d
pip install .
```

<br>

#### Full install

> **N.B.:** Only needed if you want to run inverse kinematics (`--do_ik True`).\
> **N.B.:** If you already have a Pose2Sim conda environment, you can skip this step. Just run `conda activate Pose2Sim` and `pip install sports2d`.

- Install Anaconda or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):\
  Open an Anaconda prompt and create a virtual environment:
  ``` cmd
  conda create -n Sports2D python=3.12 -y
  conda activate Sports2D
  ```
- **Install OpenSim**:\
  Install the OpenSim Python API (if you do not want to install via conda, refer [to this page](https://opensimconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenSim/pages/53085346/Scripting+in+Python#ScriptinginPython-SettingupyourPythonscriptingenvironment(ifnotusingconda))):
    ```
    conda install -c opensim-org opensim -y
    ```
   
- **Install Sports2D with Pose2Sim**:
  ``` cmd
  pip install sports2d
  ```


<br>

### Demonstration

#### Run the demo:

Just open a command line and run:
``` cmd
sports2d
```

You should see the joint positions and angles being displayed in real time.

Check the folder where you run that command line to find the resulting `video`, `images`, `TRC pose` and `MOT angle` files (which can be opened with any spreadsheet software), and `logs`.

***Important:*** If you ran the conda install, you first need to activate the environment: run `conda activate sports2d` in the Anaconda prompt.

<img src="Content/Demo_terminal.png" width="760">

***Note:***\
The Demo video is voluntarily challenging to demonstrate the robustness of the process after sorting, interpolation and filtering. It contains:
- One person walking in the sagittal plane
- One person doing jumping jacks in the frontal plane. This person then performs a flip while being backlit, both of which are challenging for the pose detection algorithm
- One tiny person flickering in the background who needs to be ignored

<br>


#### Visualize in Blender

1. **Install the Pose2Sim_Blender add-on.**\
   Follow instructions on the [Pose2Sim_Blender](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Pose2Sim_Blender) add-on page.
2. **Import the camera and video.**
    - **Cameras -> Import**: Open your `demo_calib.toml` file from your `result_dir` folder.
    - **Images/Videos -> Show**: open your video file (e.g., `demo_Sports2D.mp4`).\
    -> **Other tools -> See through camera**
2. **Open your point coordinates.**\
   **OpenSim data -> Markers**: Open your trc file(e.g., `demo_Sports2D_m_person00.trc`) from your `result_dir` folder.\
   This will optionally create **an animated rig** based on the motion of the captured person.
3. **Open your animated skeleton:**\
   Make sure you first set `--do_ik True` ([full install](#full-install) required). See [inverse kinematics](#run-inverse-kinematics) section for more details.
   - **OpenSim data -> Model**: Open your scaled model (e.g., `demo_Sports2D_m_person00_LSTM.osim`). 
   - **OpenSim data -> Motion**: Open your motion file (e.g., `demo_Sports2D_m_person00_LSTM_ik.mot`). 

   The OpenSim skeleton is not rigged yet. **[Feel free to contribute!](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/40)** [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1183750225471492206?logo=Discord&label=Discord%20community)](https://discord.com/invite/4mXUdSFjmt)

<br>


#### Visualize in OpenSim

1. Install **[OpenSim GUI](https://simtk.org/frs/index.php?group_id=91)**.
2. **Visualize point coordinates:**\
   **File -> Preview experimental data:** Open your trc file (e.g., `coords_m.trc`) from your `result_dir` folder.
3. **Visualize angles:**\
   To open an animated model and run further biomechanical analysis, make sure you first set `--do_ik True` ([full install](#full-install) required). See [inverse kinematics](#run-inverse-kinematics) section for more details. 
   - **File -> Open Model:** Open your scaled model (e.g., `Model_Pose2Sim_LSTM.osim`).
   - **File -> Load Motion:** Open your motion file (e.g., `angles.mot`).

### Play with the parameters

For a full list of the available parameters, see [this section](#all-the-parameters) of the documentation, check the [Config_Demo.toml](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D/blob/main/Sports2D/Demo/Config_demo.toml) file, or type `sports2d --help`. All non specified are set to default values.

<br>


#### Run on a custom video or on a webcam:
``` cmd
sports2d --video_input path_to_video.mp4
```

``` cmd
sports2d --video_input webcam
```

<br>

#### Run for a specific time range:
```cmd
sports2d --time_range 1.2 2.7
```
 
<br>


#### Select the persons you are interested in:
If you only want to analyze a subset of the detected persons, you can use the `--nb_persons_to_detect` and `--person_ordering_method` parameters. The order matters if you want to [convert coordinates in meters](#get-coordinates-in-meters) or [run inverse kinematics](#run-inverse-kinematics). 


``` cmd
sports2d --nb_persons_to_detect 2 --person_ordering_method highest_likelihood
```

We recommend using the `on_click` method if you can afford a manual input. This lets the user handle both the person number and their order in the same stage. When prompted, select the persons you are interested in in the desired order. In our case, lets slide to a frame where both people are visible, and select the woman first, then the man.

Otherwise, if you want to run Sports2D automatically for example, you can choose other ordering methods such as 'highest_likelihood', 'largest_size', 'smallest_size',  'greatest_displacement', 'least_displacement', 'first_detected', or 'last_detected'.

``` cmd
sports2d --person_ordering_method on_click
```



<img src="Content/Person_selection.png" width="760">


<br>


#### Get coordinates in meters: 
> **N.B.:** The Z coordinate (depth) should not be overly trusted. 

You may want coordinates in meters rather than pixels. 2 options to do so:

1. **Just provide the height of a reference person**:
   - Their height in meters is be compared with their height in pixels to get a pixel-to-meter conversion factor.
   - To estimate the depth coordinates, specify which side of the person is visible: `left`, `right`, `front`, or `back`. Use `auto` if you want it to be automatically determined (only works for motions in the sagittal plane), or `none` if you want to keep 2D coordinates instead of 3D (if the person turns around, for example).
   - The floor angle is automatically estimated from gait, as well as the origin of the xy axis. The person trajectory is corrected accordingly. You can use the `--floor_angle` and `--xy_origin` parameters to manually specify them if your subject is not travelling horizontally or if you want the origin not to be under their feet (note that the `y` axis points down).
   
   **N.B.: A calibration file will be generated.** By convention, the camera-to-subject distance is set to 10 meters.

   ``` cmd
   sports2d --first_person_height 1.65 --visible_side auto front none
   ```
   ``` cmd
   sports2d --first_person_height 1.65 --visible_side auto front none `
            --person_ordering_method on_click `
            --floor_angle 0 --xy_origin 0 940
   ```

2. **Or use a calibration file**:\
  It can either be a `.toml` calibration file previously generated by Sports2D, or a more accurate one coming from another system. For example, [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) can be used to accurately calculate calibration, or to convert calibration files from Qualisys, Vicon, OpenCap, FreeMoCap, etc.

   ``` cmd
   sports2d --calib_file Calib_demo.toml --visible_side auto front none
   ```

<br>


#### Run inverse kinematics:
> N.B.: [Full install](#full-install) required.

> **N.B.:** The person needs to be moving on a single plane for the whole selected time range.

OpenSim inverse kinematics allows you to set joint constraints, joint angle limits, to constrain the bones to keep the same length all along the motion and potentially to have equal sizes on left and right side. Most generally, it gives more biomechanically accurate results. It can also give you the opportunity to compute joint torques, muscle forces, ground reaction forces, and more, [with MoCo](https://opensim-org.github.io/opensim-moco-site/) for example.

This is done via [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim).\
Model scaling is done according to the mean of the segment lengths, across a subset of frames. We remove the 10% fastest frames (potential outliers), the frames where the speed is 0 (person probably out of frame), the frames where the average knee and hip flexion angles are above 45° (pose estimation is not precise when the person is crouching) and the 20% most extreme segment values after the previous operations (potential outliers). All these parameters can be edited in your Config.toml file.

**N.B.: This will not work on sections where the person is not moving in a single plane. You can split your video into several time ranges if needed.**

```cmd
sports2d --time_range 1.2 2.7 `
         --do_ik true --first_person_height 1.65 --visible_side auto front
```

You can optionally use the LSTM marker augmentation to improve the quality of the output motion.\
You can also optionally give the participants proper masses. Mass has no influence on motion, only on forces (if you decide to further pursue kinetics analysis).\
Optionally again, you can [visualize the overlaid results in Blender](#visualize-in-blender). The automatic calibration won't be accurate with such a small time range, so you need to use the provided calibration file (or one that has been generated from the full walk).

```cmd
sports2d --time_range 1.2 2.7 `
         --do_ik true --first_person_height 1.65 --visible_side left front `
         --use_augmentation True --participant_mass 55.0 67.0 `
         --calib_file Calib_demo.toml
```

<br>


#### Run on several videos at once:
``` cmd
sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4
```
All videos analyzed with the same time range.
```cmd
sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4 --time_range 1.2 2.7
```
Different time ranges for each video.
```cmd
sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4 --time_range 1.2 2.7 0 3.5
```

<br>


#### Use the configuration file or run within Python:

- Run with a configuration file:
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --config Config_demo.toml
  ```
- Run within Python, for example:\
  - Edit `Demo/Config_demo.toml` and run:
    ```python
    from Sports2D import Sports2D
    from pathlib import Path
    import toml

    config_path = Path(Sports2D.__file__).parent / 'Demo'/'Config_demo.toml'
    config_dict = toml.load(config_path)
    Sports2D.process(config_dict)
    ```
  - Or you can pass the non default values only: 
    ```python
    from Sports2D import Sports2D
    config_dict = {
      'base': {
        'nb_persons_to_detect': 1,
        'person_ordering_method': 'greatest_displacement'
        },
      'pose': {
        'mode': 'lightweight', 
        'det_frequency': 50
        }}
    Sports2D.process(config_dict)
    ```

<br>


#### Get the angles the way you want:

- Choose which angles you need:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --joint_angles 'right knee' 'left knee' --segment_angles None
  ```
- Choose where to display the angles: either as a list on the upper-left of the image, or near the joint/segment, or both:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --display_angle_values_on body # OR none, or list
  ```
- You can also decide not to calculate and display angles at all:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --calculate_angles false
  ```
- Flip angles when the person faces the other side.\
  **N.B.:** *We consider that the person looks to the right if their toe keypoint is to the right of their heel. This is not always true when the person is sprinting, especially in the swing phase. Set it to false if you want timeseries to be continuous even when the participant switches their stance.*
  ```cmd
  sports2d --flip_left_right true # Default
  ```
- Correct segment angles according to the estimated camera tilt angle.\
  **N.B.:** *The camera tilt angle is automatically estimated. Set to false if it is actually the floor which is tilted rather than the camera.*
  ```cmd
  sports2d --correct_segment_angles_with_floor_angle true # Default
  ```

- To run **inverse kinematics with OpenSim**, check [this section](#run-inverse-kinematics)

<br>


#### Customize your output:
- Choose whether you want video, images, trc pose file, angle mot file, real-time display, and plots:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --save_vid false --save_img true `
           --save_pose false --save_angles true `
           --show_realtime_results false --show_graphs false
  ```
- Save results to a custom directory, specify the slow-motion factor:
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --result_dir path_to_result_dir
  ```

<br>


#### Use a custom pose estimation model:
- Retrieve hand motion:
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --pose_model whole_body 
  ```
- Use any custom (deployed) MMPose model
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --pose_model BodyWithFeet : `
           --mode """{'det_class':'YOLOX', `
                  'det_model':'https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/yolox_m_8xb8-300e_humanart-c2c7a14a.zip', `
                  'det_input_size':[640, 640], `
                  'pose_class':'RTMPose', `

### Too slow for you?

**Quick fixes:**
- Use ` --save_vid false --save_img false --show_realtime_results false`: Will not save images or videos, and will not display the results in real time. 
- Use `--mode lightweight`: Will use a lighter version of RTMPose, which is faster but less accurate.\
Note that any detection and pose models can be used (first [deploy them with MMPose](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/how_to_deploy.html#onnx) if you do not have their .onnx or .zip files), with the following formalism:
  ```
  --mode """{'det_class':'YOLOX',
          'det_model':'https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/yolox_nano_8xb8-300e_humanart-40f6f0d0.zip',
          'det_input_size':[416,416],
          'pose_class':'RTMPose',
          'pose_model':'https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/rtmpose-t_simcc-body7_pt-body7_420e-256x192-026a1439_20230504.zip',
          'pose_input_size':[192,256]}"""
  ```
- Use `--det_frequency 50`: Rtmlib is (by default) a top-down method: detects bounding boxes for every person in the frame, and then detects keypoints inside of each box. The person detection stage is much slower. You can choose to detect persons only every 50 frames (for example), and track bounding boxes inbetween, which is much faster.
- Use `--load_trc_px <path_to_file_px.trc>`: Will use pose estimation results from a file. Useful if you want to use different parameters for pixel to meter conversion or angle calculation without running detection and pose estimation all over.
- Make sure you use `--tracking_mode sports2d`: Will use the default Sports2D tracker. Unlike DeepSort, it is faster, does not require any parametrization, and is as good in non-crowded scenes. 

<br> 

**Use your GPU**:\
Will be much faster, with no impact on accuracy. However, the installation takes about 6 GB of additional storage space.

1. Run `nvidia-smi` in a terminal. If this results in an error, your GPU is probably not compatible with CUDA. If not, note the "CUDA version": it is the latest version your driver is compatible with (more information [on this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60987997/why-torch-cuda-is-available-returns-false-even-after-installing-pytorch-with)).

   Then go to the [ONNXruntime requirement page](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements), note the latest compatible CUDA and cuDNN requirements. Next, go to the [pyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and install the latest version that satisfies these requirements (beware that torch 2.4 ships with cuDNN 9, while torch 2.3 installs cuDNN 8). For example:
   ``` cmd
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
   ```

<!-- > ***Note:*** Issues were reported with the default command. However, this has been tested and works:
`pip install torch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` -->

2. Finally, install ONNX Runtime with GPU support:
   ```
   pip uninstall onnxruntime
   pip install onnxruntime-gpu
   ```

3. Check that everything went well within Python with these commands:
   ``` bash
   python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
   python -c 'import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.get_available_providers())'
   # Should print "True ['CUDAExecutionProvider', ...]"
   ```
   <!-- print(f'torch version: {torch.__version__}, cuda version: {torch.version.cuda}, cudnn version: {torch.backends.cudnn.version()}, onnxruntime version: {ort.__version__}') -->

### How it works

Sports2D:
- Detects 2D joint centers from a video or a webcam with RTMLib.
- Converts pixel coordinates to meters.
- Computes selected joint and segment angles. 
- Optionally performs kinematic optimization via OpenSim.
- Optionally saves processed image and video files. 

<br>

**Okay but how does it work, really?**\
Sports2D:

1. **Reads stream from a webcam, from one video, or from a list of videos**. Selects the specified time range to process.

2. **Sets up pose estimation with RTMLib.** It can be run in lightweight, balanced, or performance mode, and for faster inference, the person bounding boxes can be tracked instead of detected every frame. Any RTMPose model can be used. 

3. **Tracks people** so that their IDs are consistent across frames. A person is associated to another in the next frame when they are at a small distance. IDs remain consistent even if the person disappears from a few frames. We crafted a 'sports2D' tracker which gives good results and runs in real time, but it is also possible to use `deepsort` in particularly challenging situations. 

4. **Chooses which persons to analyze.** In single-person mode, only keeps the person with the highest average scores over the sequence. In multi-person mode, you can choose the number of persons to analyze (`nb_persons_to_detect`), and how to order them (`person_ordering_method`). The ordering method can be 'on_click', 'highest_likelihood', 'largest_size', 'smallest_size', 'greatest_displacement', 'least_displacement', 'first_detected', or 'last_detected'. `on_click` is default and lets the user click on the persons they are interested in, in the desired order.

4. **Converts the pixel coordinates to meters.** The user can provide the size of a specified person to scale results accordingly. The floor angle and the coordinate origin can either be detected automatically from the gait sequence, or be manually specified. The depth coordinates are set to normative values, depending on whether the person is going left, right, facing the camera, or looking away.

5. **Computes the selected joint and segment angles**, and flips them on the left/right side if the respective foot is pointing to the left/right. 

5. **Draws the results on the image:**\
  Draws bounding boxes around each person and writes their IDs\
  Draws the skeleton and the keypoints, with a green to red color scale to account for their confidence\
  Draws joint and segment angles on the body, and writes the values either near the joint/segment, or on the upper-left of the image with a progress bar

6. **Interpolates and filters results:** (1) Swaps between right and left limbs are corrected, (2) Missing pose and angle sequences are interpolated unless gaps are too large, (3) Outliers are rejected with a Hampel filter, and finally (4) Results are filtered, by default with a 6 Hz Butterworth filter. All of the above can be configured or deactivated, and other filters such as Kalman, GCV, Gaussian, LOESS, Median, and Butterworth on speeds are also available (see [Config_Demo.toml](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D/blob/main/Sports2D/Demo/Config_demo.toml))

7. **Optionally show** processed images, saves them, or saves them as a video\
  **Optionally plots** pose and angle data before and after processing for comparison\
  **Optionally saves** poses for each person as a TRC file in pixels and meters, angles as a MOT file, and calibration data as a [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) TOML file 

8. **Optionally runs scaling and inverse kinematics** with OpenSim via [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim).

**Joint angle conventions:**
- Ankle dorsiflexion: Between heel and big toe, and ankle and knee.\
  *-90° when the foot is aligned with the shank.*
- Knee flexion: Between hip, knee, and ankle.\
  *0° when the shank is aligned with the thigh.*
- Hip flexion: Between knee, hip, and shoulder.\
  *0° when the trunk is aligned with the thigh.* 
- Shoulder flexion: Between hip, shoulder, and elbow.\
  *180° when the arm is aligned with the trunk.*
- Elbow flexion: Between wrist, elbow, and shoulder.\
  *0° when the forearm is aligned with the arm.*

**Segment angle conventions:**\
Angles are measured anticlockwise between the horizontal and the segment.
- Foot: Between heel and big toe
- Shank: Between ankle and knee
- Thigh: Between hip and knee
- Pelvis: Between left and right hip
- Trunk: Between hip midpoint and shoulder midpoint
- Shoulders: Between left and right shoulder
- Head: Between neck and top of the head
- Arm: Between shoulder and elbow
- Forearm: Between elbow and wrist
